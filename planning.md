# Hardware platform - ideas

## Hexapod

### Pros

- can perform complex motions including climbing over stairs

### Cons
- complex actuation and motion control
- mainly hardware development
- must be lightweight

## Wheeled Platform

### Pros

- easy to construct
- faster than an walking platform
- can transport things

### Cons

- can get stuck at obstacles or in corners


## Hardware

- base platform should be modular -> manuel prints everything
- 4 wheels and assembled motor electronic, motors
- servo for steering
- ÂµC for first tests?
- raspberry pi and faster one for SLAM?
- camera (Realsense?)
- battery! + charger
- LED stripes!

## Simualtion

- tests in Gazebo
- construction in CAD -> Manuel
